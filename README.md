# docker-dev-env
Development environment I use on daily basis. It is easier to install 
dotfiles (zsh, vim, themes, dircolors, etc) and configure it via Docker
on new machines and/or access it remotely.

Another plus is being able to test the `dotfiles` repository from 
scratch and ensure everything configures correctly out-of-the-box.
